# Universal Project Scaffold
This is a dockerized Dash application.

### Quickstart Guide for Local Deployment

Make sure docker is installed on your system. Look that up if you don't know what that means.

cd into the root director of the repo then run 

`docker build -t omni .`

once built, run

`docker run -d -p 9000:80 --restart=unless-stopped --name omni omni`

you should then be able to see the `omni` container running when you run 

`docker ps -a`

if it seems to be stuck (i.e. constantly listed as `Restarting`), something is wrong with the docker image or code inside causing it to repeatedly fail.

you can start debugging the project by running 

`docker logs -f omni` 

or

`docker exec -it omni /bin/bash` for an interactive bash terminal (this option only works if the container is running and not stuck in a restart loop)
